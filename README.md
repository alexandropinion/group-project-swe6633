# Final Project
 SWE 6633 - Group 8 - Software Project Planning and Management

## Goal
Develop a project management system which keeps track of other projects. For
each project, it receives a list of functional and non-functional requirements (as
input, in addition to owner's name, etc.) and allows the user to view the total
expended hours by requirements analysis, designing, coding, testing, and project
management.

## Functionality
Your software should include the following set of functions.
### A. A General section that allows the input of the following information:
1. A high level description of the software project
2. The owner or the project manager name
3. A list of project team members (which may vary as the project progresses)
4. A list of risks and risk status

### B. Project Requirements
1. Have a feature that allows the user to enter a list of functional and non-
functional requirements for the software project

### C. Project Effort Monitoring and Tracking
1. Have a feature that allows the user to enter (at a daily or weekly basis) the
effort in number of person hours expended on Requirements Analysis,
Designing, Coding, Testing, Project Management (by each of the earlier
entered requirements)

2. Have a feature that allows the user to view the total expended hours by
requirements analysis, designing, coding, testing, project management (by
each of the requirement entered).
Your team will need to indicate (in your plan) how much of the functionalities and
features your team will include as part of the project; then proceed to develop the
committed material.

## Plan
Your Project Plan will be composed of 4 parts:
1. A description of the project (the functionalities and features), the goals for
the project (e.g. product quality, product competitiveness, project
effectiveness, etc.) , and the major external deliverables (e.g. code,
documents, presentations)

2. An assessment of the total cost in terms of resources (person months or
person days or person hours) needed, with a short discussion on the rationale
for this assessment. Note: your rationale will be based on what you know
from either previous courses, work experiences, or both since we are still
early in this course and may not have discussed this topic in full yet.

3. A schedule (based on some software engineering process that you picked)
with a statement on the rationale behind the process and the schedule.

4. Risks and assumptions. Just list 3 or 4 top risks since this may be very long.
